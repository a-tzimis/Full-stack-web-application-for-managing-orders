Web based application for taking and managing orders in hotels and restaurants. The application is full stack and is mainly using javascript and various frameworks 
throughout. Front end is Vue js, back end and middleware are node js and express js, the database is NoSQL, built using MongoDb. The application is responsive and runs on 
various different devices such as computers, mobile phones and tablets (whatever device can run a modern browser). The Application also makes use of symmetric 
and assymetric encryption (HTTPS, SSH) as well as password hashing (SHA256) before inserting to the database.

In order for the application to function you must have the required node modules installed, as well as the database dump that I've used (The database is supposed to change 
depending on the client's needs). To get the dump file please contact me at anastasistzimis@gmail.com
